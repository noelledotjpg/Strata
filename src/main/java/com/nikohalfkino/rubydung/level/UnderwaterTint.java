/**
 * how much liquid lies over a terrain face, packed into the vertex alpha for TerrainShader (keep the two in sync).
 *
 * two kinds of value, both packed / PACK_RANGE, and exactly 1.0 means "no liquid", which is what every other vertex already writes:
 *
 *   STORED liquid (flowing / poured / another liquid): p = liquidIndex * 256 + eighths, always below OCEAN_BASE.
 *     the depth is the liquid above the cell in front of the face: its own fill plus every liquid cell stacked directly over it,
 *     in eighths of a block (LiquidLayer.MAX_FILL per block)
 *
 *   OCEAN: p = OCEAN_BASE + wetFrom * 512 + cellY. nothing about the current sea height is baked in: the cell is under the sea
 *     once seaHeight > wetFrom (LiquidLayer.oceanWetFrom) and its depth is seaHeight - cellY. the shader gets seaHeight and the
 *     ocean's liquid as uniforms, so moving the sea needs no chunk to be rebuilt
 *
 * the liquid's own colour and opacity tint and darken the face, so the deeper the water, the darker the sea floor
